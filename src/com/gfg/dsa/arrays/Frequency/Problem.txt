Given an array A[] of n positive integers which can contain integers from 1 to n where elements can be repeated or can be absent from the array. Your task is to count the frequency of all elements from 1 to n.


Example 1:

Input:
n = 5
A[] = {2,3,2,3,5}
Output:
0 2 2 0 1
Explanation:
Counting frequencies of each array element
We have:
1 occurring 0 times.
2 occurring 2 times.
3 occurring 2 times.
4 occurring 0 times.
5 occurring 1 time.
Example 2:

Input:
n = 4
A[] = {3,3,3,3}
Output:
0 0 4 0
Explanation:
Counting frequencies of each array element
We have:
1 occurring 0 times.
2 occurring 0 times.
3 occurring 4 times.
4 occurring 0 times.

Your Task:
Complete the function frequencycount() that takes the array and n as input parameters and updates the given array in place to denote the frequency count of each element from 1 to n. ie- element at index 0 should represent frequency of 1 and so on. The driver code prints the contents of the modified array.


Expected Time Complexity: O(n)
Expected Auxiliary Space: O(1)


Constraints:
1 ≤ n ≤ 4*104
1 <= A[i] <= n
